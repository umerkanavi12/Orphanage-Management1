<h1>What lead to the establishment of Twin City Orphanage Management?</h1></br>
<p align="justify">Twin city Orphanages management system was established with a mission to donate ,assist and empower orphans , semi-orphans across Hubli-Dharwad.
Some of the Non-government Organizations(NGO’s) that are run by small organizations remain unrecognized by people.These NGOs that help and rise orphans and semi-orphans strive hard to raise funds and donations since most of the donation is received by well known orphanages which leads to lack of resources and non-conducive/quality environment for children.Also Orphanages lack providing exposure to the children which stagnates the mental and physical health of the children.
This project will connect all the NGOs that work for the welfare of the children across Hubli – Dharwad. With proper survey of requirements of orphanages it is made sure that the donation received through the website will be directed to the most needy orphanage. Also people wishing to volunteer for education,counseling,medical assistance etc at orphanages can register through our website. With this we try to enhance the functioning of NGOs which in turn leads to a better future of  children.</p>
